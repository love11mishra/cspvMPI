This directory contains several versions of programs of a simple 
accumulation algorithm which are all functional equivalent.

The structure of the directory is:

  adder_demo/     
    adder_mpi.c   /* A simple parallel version of an adder program 
                   * which uses some constant values as initial data

    adder_bad_io.c       /* A buggy version of an adder program which uses file input 
                          * and output*/

Make: type "make" under each directory will run different versions of programs 
      and compare outputs of parallel and sequential ones.
